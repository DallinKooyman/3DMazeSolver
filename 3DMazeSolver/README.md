# 3D Maze Solver
Exploring a 3D maze

## Purpose
This lab helped me gain experience with recursion.
Can put in a 5x5x5 maze and find the solution

## Background Info
This was a project for class where we learned about recursion. The goal was to make a 3D maze solver.
For the project all the mazes were 5x5x5 but adjusting some of the numbers would most likely allow for
mazes of all different sizes.

Since this was for school, my proffesor wrote the main.cpp file and the PathfinderInterface.h file. The
only addition I made to these was adjust the main file was having it output the solution to the outfile.
That is why there are 2 folders: the original fixed project and the one that outputs the solution.
The professor also wrote the all the mazes, key files, file1-5, and the check.sh.

The code I wrote is in the Pathfinder.h and Pathfinder.cpp file.

## Running
Just compile and run. The code gets the mazes from the maze folder, calls code based of the command in
the numbered file, and then outputs to the out_file with the corresponding number. Using check.sh the
out files and the key files can be compared for differences. Note a difference will always be found if
the code that shows the solution is run.
